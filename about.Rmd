I am currently a first year Masters student studying Biostatistics at Mailman School of Public Health. 

Born and raised in Seoul, South Korea, I moved to the U.S. with my sister and my mother in search for better education and opportunity. Growing up, I fell in love with the game of basketball and used it as a means to incorporate myself into the U.S. culture and society. I acquired my Bachelors Degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Attached is my resume.
